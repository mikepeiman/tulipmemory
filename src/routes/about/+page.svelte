            <p><strong class="text-xl">Hello, my name is Bill Peiman,</strong> and I founded Tulip Electronics Inc. in 1988. The Tulip was chosen as a simple homage to the Netherlands, where I was born and raised. I immigrated to Canada in 1966 and launched my career as an industrial service technician in the '70s. I've been in Ontario, Canada, and in the CNC business ever since - though the business has taken me to many countries around the world, and we ship internationally.</p>

        <p>Tulip Electronics has always been a family-owned small business, and we pride ourselves on the level of individual service and support we are able to provide our customers. We design, build and test our own memory. We offer <a href="/terms" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">industry-leading warranties, technical support, and rates.</a></p>
        
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">We deliver reliable upgrades for your CNC controls, and we've been doing it for 28 years.</p>
